Yet another [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh) custom theme. 

---

### Quick Start:

After your [zsh](http://www.zsh.org/) and [OMZ](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh) are ready.

Save and copy the theme file `xxf.zsh-theme` into `~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/themes/`.

Use your favorite editor to open the file `~/.zshrc`

Find the field  `SH_THEME` then set value to `"xxf"`:

```sh
ZSH_THEME="xxf"
```

Save the file then open a new terminal. That's it!

If everything is ok, the result should be:
